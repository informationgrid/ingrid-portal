            <header>Concept and tasking of PortalU</header>
            <content>
                <p>PortalU, Germany’s environment portal, provides a central 
				point to access several million intent pages as well as over 500.000 
				catalogue- and data base entries of public institutions and 
				organisations in the Federation, the Federal States and the 
				Local Authorities. With a mix of current news, environmental 
				readings (e.g. current ozone concentration in the air, water quality), 
				background information and historic environment events, PortalU is aimed 
				at interested lay persons as well as the specialist audience. 
				The information provided is being continually added to with the aim of 
				capturing all official providers of environment information over the long term.</p>
                <p>The EU environment guideline of 2003 and the planned INSPIRE guideline played an important role in the conception of PortalU. These guidelines lay down new standards for the public dissemination of official environment information respectively the construction of the information technology infrastructures necessary for this. In future, signficantly more authorities and organisations than heretofore will be obliged to provide data relevant to the environment in a clear understandable and easily accessible form</p>
                <p> PortalU and the software especially developed for the construction of the portal ?InGrid<sup>®</sup>? were especially conceived as tools to support the authorities in implementing the guidelines. </p>

                <p> PortalU was developed as a follow-up project of the environment data catalogue (UDK) and of the German Environmental 
				    Information Network (gein) within the framework of the Federal Republic of Germany Federal States administration 
					agreement (Verwaltungsvereinbarung UDK/GEIN). The Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and 
					Nuclear Safety (BMU) and the Environment Ministries of 16 German Federal States were signatories to the administration 
					agreement. PortalU is managed and maintained from a technical and contents point of view by the Coordination Center PortalU 
					in the Lower Saxony Ministry for Environment, Energy and Climate Protection in Hanover.</p>

            <content>
                <p>The InGrid<sup>®</sup> software package was developed to realise PortalU. InGrid<sup>®</sup> is positioned on modular and flexible system architecture based on licence-free open source products. This way it becomes possible to adapt the technical structure of the environment information net to changing organisational specifications. Thus, if needed, regional environment portals, e.g. for individual German Federal States or Local Authorities can be created with minimal technical expense. Thanks to Open Source the follow up use of the software is license free and free of cost for partners of the VwV UDK/GEIN.</p>

                <content>
                    <p>In PortalU the environmental thesaurus UMTHES from the German Federal environmental agency Umweltbundesamt is used. A thesaurus 
					   consists, like a dictionary, of specialist terms on a certain subject area. In addition to the correct spelling, a thesaurus 
					   also contains information whether and how a term can be generalised (superordinate terms), specialised (subordinate terms) or 
					   expressed in another way (synonyms). Thesauri are used, for example, for indexing keywords and finding documents. </p>
                    <p>The UMTHES contains more than 30,000 specialist terms, which are related to the topic <b>environment</b>. The single terms can 
					   have one or serveral superordinate, subordinate, silimilar terms and/or synonyms. A related term is an thesaurus term that 
					   is connected with the thesaurus keyword, but is neither a super- nor a subordinate term. A thesaurus term can possess any 
					   number of related terms. A synonym is an alternative expression, but one with the same meaning for the thesaurus keyword. 
					   Sometimes a synonym consists of two or several thesaurus terms. In this case, the synonym is not to be understood as an 
					   alternative expression for a single thesaurus term but as a synonym for the combined term.</p>
                    <p>The UMTHES is made available via the <a href="http://www.semantic-network.de/" target="_new">Semantic Network Service (SNS)</a>

          <content>
               <p><b>You have added a map and activated the layers, but you can’t see any data?</b></p>
               <p>Some layers are only displayed at certain scales. The layers are displayed, when the scale of the current map view and the layer scale match. Otherwise the names of the layers are greyed out (flag active services) and the data are not drawn. You can make the data visible by zooming into the map or by using the feature <b>Zoom to service or layer extend</b> <img border="0" width="24" height="22" src="../decorations/layout/ingrid-help/images/image113.jpg" alt="*"></img> . </p> 
			   
               <p><b>Navigating the map</b></p>
               <p>You can navigate in the map by moving the red rectangle in the overview map located in the lower right of the map viewer. Or you can pan the map by pressing the <b>CTRL</b> key and dragging with the <b>left mouse</b> key.</p>
              
			  <p><b>Zoom in the map</b></p>
			   <p>Instead of using the navigation controls to zoom in the map, hold the <b>Shift</b> key and drag a zoom box on the map with the <b>left mouse</b> key.</p>

               <p><b>Can I choose different scale levels?</b></p>
               <p>You can determine different scale levels by expanding the dialogue window <b>Extended Preferences</b>.</p>
			   
               <p><b>A top layer overlapps information of underlying layers</b></p>
               <p>When several layers are activated, some layer information may be overlapped. You can add transparency to the top layer to see the underlying layers. Click the layer you want to appear transparent and use the button layer <b>transparency</b> <img border="0" width="26" height="19" src="../decorations/layout/ingrid-help/images/image101.jpg" alt="*"></img> to adjust the transparency by the slider bar.

                    <p>In this area you can set which contents are to be displayed in which order on your personal start page. For this you set the contents of lines 1 to 3 in the main column (on the left) of the start page via the dropdown list. If you do not set your contents at all (empty entry in the dropdown list) this is also not displayed.</p>
                    <p>You can follow the same procedure for the margin column (narrower margin on the right side) of the start page.</p>
						
 				 <p>The determinations are not saved permanently as presetting. After click on <i>Logout</i> you return to the startpage of PortalU with its own presettings.</p>

                    <p>As well as the usual web servers, metadata and specialist data systems are also connected to PortalU. You can now select whether you want to search in all data sources (standard) or whether you would like to restrict your search in a targeted manner to one or several types of data sources.</p>
                    <p>If you limit yourself to metadata then you will continue to have the possibility of selecting the classes of metadata you would like to search. The following classes are available to you:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Organisational Unit / Task</li>

						<li>Data Pooling / Data Base</li>
						<li>Service / Application / Information System </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The settings made will be effective on a lasting basis as preset settings. You can however overwrite them via temporary settings for individual searches. </p>

                    <p>You can display your search results either according to ranking (relevance of the page found with regard to your search term) or according to actuality (the latest pages are shown first).</p>
                    <p>Grouping means that all search results of a page are collected in groups. Depending on the setting, all the search results for the Federation or of a Federal State are collected together or those of all providers or domains.</p>

                        <b>Include similar terms in the search </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>PortalU not only performs the usual indexing of the pages found on search engines but gets the page contents analysed by the n <a href="http://www.semantic-network.de/" target="_new">Semantic Network Service (SNS)</a> of the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt). As a result of this analysis, appropriate technical terms from the <a href="?hkey=ext-search-subject-4#ext-search-subject-4">Environment-Thesaurus</a>
                        are assigned to the web pages.</p>
                    <p>If you select the setting <i>Include similar terms in search</i> by putting a cross then these keywords will be taken account of in the search. (Note: one should assume that selecting this setting increases the number of hits.)</p>
                    <p>The settings will be effective on a lasting basis as preset settings for the display of the search result list, but can be overwritten via settings in <i>Search</i> for individual searches. </p>
